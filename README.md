# Taxonomy Plot Generator for Metagenomic Samples
This GitHub project provides a tool to generate taxonomy abundance plots for metagenomic samples using the common output format (BIOM file) from popular taxonomic assigners such as Kraken, Bracken, and more. With this tool, you can visualize the composition of microbial communities at different taxonomic levels, including Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, or Species.
